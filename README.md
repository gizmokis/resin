# C++ OpenGL Template

This repository provides a cross-platform (currently only Linux and Windows are tested) template for library-executable
OpenGL project. The repository is based on the *CMake* build system and uses *clang-tidy* and
*clang-format* to assert code quality and force consistent code style among developers. The repository depends on
*GLAD*, *GLFW*, *GLM* and *ImGui* that are built as static libraries when you build the
project.

To see how to configure, run and debug the code follow the [Setup Guide](docs/dev/SetupGuide.md). If you want to learn
more how to work with the repository see the [Working With The Repository](docs/dev/WorkingWithTheRepository.md)
guide.
